# Reflection


In this lab I learned how GitHub is used not only to store code but also to manage a project properly. Before this, I mostly uploaded files directly to the main branch without thinking about structure. Creating feature branches and merging them using pull requests helped me understand how developers separate their work and keep the main branch stable.
One thing that took me some time to fully understand was how branches actually work. At first I was confused about why we should not just commit everything directly to main. After creating separate branches for UI improvements and JavaScript enhancements, it became clearer how changes can be tested and reviewed before merging. It made the workflow feel more organized and professional.
Using issues was also useful. Instead of randomly editing files, I had clear tasks to complete. It made the project feel more structured and easier to track. I also realized how important commit messages are. Writing meaningful commit messages makes it easier to understand what changes were made and why.
The most interesting part for me was merging the pull requests and seeing the changes integrated into the main branch. It gave a better understanding of how collaboration would work in a real team environment.
If I had more time, I would improve the project by adding more features and maybe making the interface more interactive. Overall, this lab helped me gain practical experience with version control and project organization using GitHub.
